## How can query multiple accounts for a lot of informaiton.

Well theres a few ways we can do this. Honestly what I beleive is that leveraging a cross account role in each account is one the best ways to hadle this. This allows for us to have the one spot for control and access. If you have a way to deploy this role in an automated way, that would be best.
